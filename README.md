# Prediction of Postoperative Infections

This repository contains the supporting code for the article titled "Prediction of Postoperative Infections by Strategic Data Imputation and Explainable Machine Learning". It includes a pre-trained model, executable code, and a notebook designed for Google Colab to facilitate replication and further exploration of the study's findings.

## Repository Structure

- **/model**: Contains the pre-trained machine learning models used in the study.
- **/code**: Includes all executable scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and generating visualizations.
- **/notebook**: A Jupyter notebook that can be uploaded to Google Colab for an interactive experience of the model's execution and testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone this repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HugoGuillen/postsurgicalinfections.git
```

##Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
